Use simple.def as a template and try to create a the following images.
1. An Opensuse image with `hostname` installed in it
2. An image built from from the previous Opensuse image with gcc installed, and a helloworld.c (or f90 or whatever) program in it. (hint: create the helloworld.c in the directory and copy it into the image during the image build).

Look in the `solution` directory if you are stuck.
