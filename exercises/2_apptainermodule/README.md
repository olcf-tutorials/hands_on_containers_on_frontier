Build a container image based on the opensusempich342rocm571.sif image from earlier with a script
that prints out the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` value. Create a job
script that updates the `APPTAINERENV_LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable with some value before
running the srun command. And then in the srun, execute with the container a script that prints out 
the value of the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` inside the running container.
