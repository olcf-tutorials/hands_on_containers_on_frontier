Use one of the base images listed on the OLCF docs (https://docs.olcf.ornl.gov/software/containers_on_frontier.html#olcf-base-images-apptainer-modules) to build a container image of your own. 

If you need an idea, try building the OSU micro benchmarks again, but this time utilizing
the MPI and GPU libraries already installed in the base image instead of installing your own
MPI and GPU.
